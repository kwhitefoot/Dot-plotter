* Dotplotter

Plot similarity of code.

Basic idea:

- Take two files, x and y.

- Tokenise both

- Create an xy dotplot

- Lay the tokens for x along the x axis and those from y along the y axis.

- In each coordinate place a dot if the x and y tokens are the same.


For example, take the last two lines:

x = "Lay the tokens for x along the x axis and those from y along the y axis"

y = "In each coordinate place a dot if the x and y tokens are the same"

No obvious patterns.

Now try a the second of those two lines versus a modified version:

x = "In every coordinate put a dot if the tokens are the same"

y = "In each coordinate place a dot if the x and y tokens are the same"

Now we can see a distinct diagonal pattern.  This shows that the two sequences are very similar.

So, how can this be implemented?  Obviously we cannot simply make a
matrix like this for any real files because they would be many
thousands of pixels wide.  Or could we?  How far can we go with a
naive implementation now that hardware is fast.

So read two files, tokenise using a regular expression for delimiters
so that we omit all punctuation.

Create a bitmap with pixel dimensions corresponding the the sizes of
the token lists.
